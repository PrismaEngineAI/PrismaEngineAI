# üìö PRISMA Engine Documentation

PRISMA Engine is an advanced text-to-video generation model that transforms textual descriptions into dynamic, high-quality 4D video content. Built on state-of-the-art transformer architecture, PRISMA Engine empowers creators and developers to bring ideas to life in a fully decentralized and community-driven way.

This documentation provides comprehensive guides, API references, tutorials, and best practices for seamless integration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for optimal performance)
- pip and virtualenv recommended

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prisma-engine/prisma-engine.git
cd prisma-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start
Use PRISMA Engine in just a few lines of code:

```python
from prisma import PrismaModel

model = PrismaModel()
video = model.generate("A beautiful sunset over the ocean")
video.save("output.mp4")
```

## üñºÔ∏è Inference Example
Generate a video from a text prompt using the CLI:

```bash
python prisma/inference.py \
    --model-path /path/to/model/weights \
    --prompt "A futuristic cityscape at night" \
    --output output.mp4 \
    --max-frames 32 \
    --frame-size 512 512
```

This will load the trained model, generate a 4D video sequence, and save it as `output.mp4`.

## üîß API Reference

### PrismaModel
```python
model = PrismaModel(model_path=None)
```

**Methods:**
- `generate(prompt: str, max_frames: int = 32, frame_size: Tuple[int, int] = (512, 512)) -> VideoObject`
  - Generates a video sequence from a text prompt.
- `save(filename: str) -> None`
  - Saves the generated video to the specified path.

### CLI Options
- `--model-path`: Path to the model weights.
- `--prompt`: Text description for video generation.
- `--output`: Output video file name.
- `--max-frames`: Number of frames to generate.
- `--frame-size`: Width and height of the video frames.

## üß© Advanced Usage

### Fine-Tuning
Use the `prisma/training.py` script to fine-tune the model with your own dataset:

```bash
python prisma/training.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --epochs 10
```

### Integration
PRISMA Engine can be integrated into web, mobile, or desktop applications via its API. See `docs/integration.md` for full integration examples.

## üé® Best Practices
- Use concise and descriptive prompts to guide the model effectively.
- Experiment with different frame sizes and resolutions to match your creative needs.
- Monitor GPU memory usage during high-resolution generation.
- Use the latest stable model weights from the official releases page.
- Validate outputs to ensure consistent quality before production use.
